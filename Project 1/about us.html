              The founder Ettore Bugatti was born in Milan, Italy, and the
              automobile company that bears his name was founded in 1909 in
              Molsheim located in the Alsace region which was part of the German
              Empire from 1871 to 1919. The company was known both for the level
              of detail of its engineering in its automobiles, and for the
              artistic manner in which the designs were executed, given the
              artistic nature of Ettore's family (his father, Carlo Bugatti
              (1856â€“1940), was an important Art Nouveau furniture and jewelry
              designer). World War I and its aftermath Bugatti Type 13 Brescia
              Sport-Racing, 1922 During the war Ettore Bugatti was sent away,
              initially to Milan and later to Paris, but as soon as hostilities
              had been concluded he returned to his factory at Molsheim.[2] Less
              than four months after the Versailles Treaty formalised the
              transfer of Alsace from Germany to France, Bugatti was able to
              obtain, at the last minute, a stand at the 15th Paris motor show
              in October 1919.[2] He exhibited three light cars, all of them
              closely based on their pre-war equivalents
